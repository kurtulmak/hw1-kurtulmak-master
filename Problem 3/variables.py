# Problem 3: Variables
#
# Recall that variables are containers for storing information. For example;
#
# Program Text:
# a = "Hello, world!"
# print a
#
# Output:
# Hello, world!
#
# The = sign is an assignment operator which tells the interpreter to assign the value "Hello, world!" to the
# variable a.
#
# Program Text:
# a = "Hello, world!"
# a = "and goodbye..."
# print a
#
# Output:
# and goodbye...
#
# Taking this second example, the value of a after executing the first line above is "Hello, world!". But, after
# executing the second line, the value of a changes to "and goodbye...". Since we ask the program to print out
# a only after the second assignment statement, that is the value that gets printed. If you wanted to save the values
# of both strings, you should change the second variable to another valid variable name, such as b.
#
# Variables are useful because they can cut down on the amount of code you have to write. In homework 1.py, write
# a program that prints out the tic-tac-toe board from exercise 1.2, but which uses variables to cut down on the
# amount of typing you have to do. Hint - how many different variables should you need?
#
# Expected output:
#   |  |
# --------
#   |  |
# --------
#   |  |

# 1. Create variables to hold the unique strings for the tic tac toe board.
a ="  |  |"
b =" -------"
# 2. Use print statements with variables to output a tic tac toe board.
print a
print b
print a
print b
print a
